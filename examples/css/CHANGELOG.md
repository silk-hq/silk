# Changelog

## v2.0.0

**Release date**: 2025-06-02

- Make each example self-contained by removing the dependance on global styles and components.
- Revamp each example's code structure to move from slots as props to compound components.
- Change the `PersistentSheetWithDetent` example so it is possible to scroll the page underneath as soon as the sheet has been swiped down instead of having to wait for the sheet animation to end.
- Change the `SheetWithDetent` example so clicking the handle when the sheet is resting on the last detent causes the sheet to be dismissed.
- Miscellaneous code improvements.
